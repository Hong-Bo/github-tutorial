This tutorial covers some basic and useful usages of git, especially topics related to repositories and branches.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

There are several things that need to be done in advance:
1. Create an account at [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/)
2. Get a computer, Mac/Linux/Windows


## Create a repository

A repository can be created in several ways:

### Using GitHub

You can create a repository on GitHub following the simple creation instructions. Do not forget initialize your repository with a README.

### From local files

More than often, you have developed some parts of a project before you realize that you want to put it on GitHub. Is it a little late? Don't worry. You can put your files on GitHub anytime you want.

Suppose you have a folder like this
```
/hello
    say_hello.py
```
Following the instructions below, you can create the repository you need.
